						<p><a href="http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Hunterpedia">Hunter × Hunter >></a> (ハンターハンター Hantā Hantā?) (stylized HUNTER×HUNTER in Japan), is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi. The story focuses on a young boy named Gon, who discovers that his father, whom he was told was dead, is actually alive and well. He learns that his father, Ging, is a world-renowned Hunter: a licensed profession for those who specialize in fantastic pursuits such as locating rare or unidentified animal species, treasure hunting, surveying unexplored enclaves, or hunting down lawless individuals. Despite Ging having left his son with his relatives in order to pursue his own dreams, Gon departs upon a journey to follow in his father's footsteps, pass the rigorous Hunter Examination, and eventually find his father. Along the way, Gon meets various other kinds of Hunters and also encounters the paranormal. The original inspiration for the manga came from Togashi's own collecting hobby.</p>
						<p>The first Hunter × Hunter anime adaptation was produced by the company Nippon Animation and directed by Kazuhiro Furuhashi, who had previously directed the Rurouni Kenshin television series.[34] A total of 62 episodes of Hunter × Hunter were broadcast on the Japanese terrestrial television network Fuji Television from October 16, 1999 to March 31, 2001 during the same Saturday evening timeslot as the anime version of Togashi's previous series YuYu Hakusho.[7][35][36] Additionally, Hunter × Hunter has aired on the satellite television station Animax.[37][38] Although it closely follows the manga, the violence in the anime version is lessened for younger audiences.[7] Marvelous Entertainment has released all episodes of the series in Japan on DVD in 13 separate volumes between September 20, 2000 and September 19, 2001.[39]

						Viz Media licensed the Hunter × Hunter anime for distribution in the Region 1 market, with English voice-work handled by The Ocean Group at Blue Water Studios in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.[6][40] The series was released on four DVD boxed sets from December 9, 2008 to December 1, 2009.[41][42] Starting with the second set, Viz partnered with Warner Home Video to distribute the DVDs.[43] Hunter × Hunter began airing in the United States on the Funimation Channel in the spring of 2009.[44]</p>
